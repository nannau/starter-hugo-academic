abstract: "Climate change has the potential to affect buildings and infrastructure by changing the conditions to which they are
exposed. To better quantify and prepare for these changes, Infrastructure Canada and the National Research Council
(NRC) recently supported a collaboration between the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) and Environment
and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) to develop updated guidance to the engineering community. One facet of this
work was the provision of standard climatic design values based on up-to-date historical observations at
meteorological stations. Climatic data for infrastructure design are often required at locations not co-located with
stations, necessitating some sort of interpolation. Purely mathematical or statistical interpolation tends to oversmooth
spatial structure in station-poor areas and, depending on the technique, can exaggerate station measurement error in
station-rich areas. Nor is physical consistency of the underlying climatic field in space guaranteed.
We developed an approach that uses historical regional climate model (RCM) simulations as a spatial interpolator of
station observations. RCMs can adequately reproduce the observed spatial patterns and probability distributions of
many climate variables, with the benefit of spatiotemporal consistency—albeit in a "model world" and at spatial scales
resolved by the RCM. The mapping method has been implemented as an online tool (the Design Value Explorer, or
DVE) for general users to explore design value variations across Canada. The seamless transition from historical to
future climate states in the RCM further allows the tool to provide projected changes to design values indexed to
different levels of global warming.
In this short paper, we review the development of the Design Value Explorer online tool, and showcase its main
features."
